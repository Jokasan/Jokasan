### Yo ✌🏼

I am a data scientist at Danone, I build systems and data products to inform stakeholder decision making. My peers call me the curious homosapien, I am passionate about data science and food policy. You can find me browsing the politics section at my local library or at a cafe debugging 
code.

Most of the projects on here are written in R, Python or Javascript. And include a variety of data visualisaiton, modelling and other random projects.
